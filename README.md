Gler from east found an <a href="https://cyrillbrito.github.io/cookieclicker/">unblocked cookie clicker</a><br/>
<br/>
<b>Explanation</b><br/>
Behind the fast-paced instructions is simply a loophole in a forgotten aspect of Microsoft login. When you attempt to sign into GitHub you have full access to the entire web, all you have to do is find a link to take you to a web browser.

<b>Updates</b><br/>
Currently working on web browser in web browser, you can find the Nuutrino test here:

<b>Self-protection</b><br/>
This isn't nefarious (trust me) just proof of concept. Anyone can use this if they like but I'm not going to so bye
